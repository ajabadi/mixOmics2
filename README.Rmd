The aim is to:

* implement [_roxygen2_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html) documentation, and
* support [_MultiAssayExperiment_](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html) datasets.
* support more intuitve input formats tailored to data integration such as `formula` class entry and support of `assay` names.
