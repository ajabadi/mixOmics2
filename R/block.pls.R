# =============================================================================
# block.pls: perform a horizontal PLS on a combination of datasets,
# input as a list in X
# this function is a particular setting of .mintBlock,
# the formatting of the input is checked in .mintWrapperBlock
# =============================================================================

# X: a list of data sets (called 'blocks') matching on the same samples.
#   Data in the list should be arranged in samples x variables,
#   with samples order matching in all data sets. \code{NA}s are not allowed.
# Y: outcome
# indY: to supply if Y is missing, indicate the position of the outcome in X.
# ncomp: numeric vector of length the number of blocks in \code{X}.
#   The number of components to include in the model for each block
#   (does not necessarily need to take the same value for each block).
#   By default set to 2 per block.
# design: the input design.
# scheme: the input scheme, one of "horst", "factorial" or ""centroid".
#   Default to "centroid"
# mode: input mode, one of "canonical", "classic", "invariant" or "regression".
#   Default to "regression"
# scale: boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
#   means and unit variances (default: TRUE).
# init: intialisation of the algorithm, one of "svd" or "svd.single".
#   Default to "svd"
# tol: Convergence stopping value.
# max.iter: integer, the maximum number of iterations.
# near.zero.var: boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}} function
#   (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero values).
# all.outputs: calculation of non-essential outputs (e.g. explained variance,
#   loadings.Astar, etc)








#' N-integration with Projection to Latent Structures models (PLS)
#'
#' Integration of multiple data sets measured on the same samples or
#' observations, ie. N-integration. The method is partly based on Generalised
#' Canonical Correlation Analysis.
#'
#' \code{block.spls} function fits a horizontal integration PLS model with a
#' specified number of components per block). An outcome needs to be provided,
#' either by \code{Y} or by its position \code{indY} in the list of blocks
#' \code{X}. Multi (continuous)response are supported. \code{X} and \code{Y}
#' can contain missing values. Missing values are handled by being disregarded
#' during the cross product computations in the algorithm \code{block.pls}
#' without having to delete rows with missing data. Alternatively, missing data
#' can be imputed prior using the \code{nipals} function.
#'
#' The type of algorithm to use is specified with the \code{mode} argument.
#' Four PLS algorithms are available: PLS regression \code{("regression")}, PLS
#' canonical analysis \code{("canonical")}, redundancy analysis
#' \code{("invariant")} and the classical PLS algorithm \code{("classic")} (see
#' References and \code{?pls} for more details).
#'
#' Note that our method is partly based on Generalised Canonical Correlation
#' Analysis and differs from the MB-PLS approaches proposed by Kowalski et al.,
#' 1989, J Chemom 3(1) and Westerhuis et al., 1998, J Chemom, 12(5).
#'
#' @param X A list of data sets (called 'blocks') measured on the same samples.
#' Data in the list should be arranged in matrices, samples x variables, with
#' samples order matching in all data sets.
#' @param Y Matrix response for a multivariate regression framework. Data
#' should be continuous variables (see block.splsda for supervised
#' classification and factor reponse)
#' @param indY To supply if Y is missing, indicates the position of the matrix
#' response in the list \code{X}
#' @param ncomp the number of components to include in the model. Default to 2.
#' Applies to all blocks.
#' @param design numeric matrix of size (number of blocks in X) x (number of
#' blocks in X) with values between 0 and 1. Each value indicates the strenght
#' of the relationship to be modelled between two blocks; a value of 0
#' indicates no relationship, 1 is the maximum value. If \code{Y} is provided
#' instead of \code{indY}, the \code{design} matrix is changed to include
#' relationships to \code{Y}.
#' @param scheme Either "horst", "factorial" or "centroid". Default =
#' \code{horst}, see reference.
#' @param mode character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially)
#' matching one of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"}
#' or \code{"classic"}. See Details. Default = \code{regression}.
#' @param scale boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
#' means and unit variances. Default = \code{TRUE}.
#' @param init Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular
#' Value Decompostion of the product of each block of X with Y ("svd") or each
#' block independently ("svd.single"). Default = \code{svd.single}.
#' @param tol Convergence stopping value.
#' @param max.iter integer, the maximum number of iterations.
#' @param near.zero.var boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}}
#' function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero
#' values). Default = \code{FALSE}.
#' @param all.outputs boolean. Computation can be faster when some specific
#' (and non-essential) outputs are not calculated. Default = \code{TRUE}.
#' @return \code{block.pls} returns an object of class \code{"block.pls"}, a
#' list that contains the following components:
#'
#' \item{X}{the centered and standardized original predictor matrix.}
#' \item{indY}{the position of the outcome Y in the output list X.}
#' \item{ncomp}{the number of components included in the model for each block.}
#' \item{mode}{the algorithm used to fit the model.} \item{variates}{list
#' containing the variates of each block of X.} \item{loadings}{list containing
#' the estimated loadings for the variates.} \item{names}{list containing the
#' names to be used for individuals and variables.} \item{nzv}{list containing
#' the zero- or near-zero predictors information.} \item{iter}{Number of
#' iterations of the algorthm for each component}
#' \item{explained_variance}{Percentage of explained variance for each
#' component and each block}
