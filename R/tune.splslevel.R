#' Tuning functions for multilevel sPLS method

#' For a multilevel spls analysis, the tuning criterion is based on the
#' maximisation of the correlation between the components from both data sets
#'
#' For a multilevel spls analysis, the tuning criterion is based on the
#' maximisation of the correlation between the components from both data sets
#'
#' @param X numeric matrix of predictors. \code{NA}s are allowed.
#' @param Y \code{if(method = 'spls')} numeric vector or matrix of continuous
#' responses (for multi-response models) \code{NA}s are allowed.
#' @param multilevel Design matrix for multilevel analysis (for repeated
#' measurements) that indicates the repeated measures on each individual, i.e.
#' the individuals ID. See Details.
#' @param ncomp the number of components to include in the model.
#' @param mode character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially)
#' matching one of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"}
#' or \code{"classic"}.
#' @param test.keepX numeric vector for the different number of variables to
#' test from the \eqn{X} data set
#' @param test.keepY numeric vector for the different number of variables to
#' test from the \eqn{Y} data set
#' @param already.tested.X Optional, if \code{ncomp > 1} A numeric vector
#' indicating the number of variables to select from the \eqn{X} data set on
#' the firsts components.
#' @param already.tested.Y Optional, if \code{ncomp > 1} A numeric vector
#' indicating the number of variables to select from the \eqn{Y} data set on
