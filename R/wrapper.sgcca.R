#' mixOmics wrapper for Sparse Generalised Canonical Correlation Analysis
#' (sgcca)
#'
#' Wrapper function to perform Sparse Generalised Canonical Correlation
#' Analysis (sGCCA), a generalised approach for the integration of multiple
#' datasets. For more details, see the \code{help(sgcca)} from the \pkg{RGCCA}
#' package.
#'
#' This wrapper function performs sGCCA (see \pkg{RGCCA}) with \eqn{1, \ldots
#' ,}\code{ncomp} components on each block data set. A supervised or
#' unsupervised model can be run. For a supervised model, the
#' \code{\link{unmap}} function should be used as an input data set. More
#' details can be found on the package \pkg{RGCCA}.
#'
#' Note that this function is the same as \code{\link{block.spls}} with
#' different default arguments.
#'
#' More details about the PLS modes in \code{?pls}.
#'
#' @param X a list of data sets (called 'blocks') matching on the same samples.
#' Data in the list should be arranged in samples x variables. \code{NA}s are
#' not allowed.
#' @param design numeric matrix of size (number of blocks in X) x (number of
#' blocks in X) with values between 0 and 1. Each value indicates the strenght
#' of the relationship to be modelled between two blocks using sGCCA; a value
#' of 0 indicates no relationship, 1 is the maximum value. If \code{Y} is
#' provided instead of \code{indY}, the \code{design} matrix is changed to
#' include relationships to \code{Y}.
#' @param penalty numeric vector of length the number of blocks in \code{X}.
#' Each penalty parameter will be applied on each block and takes the value
#' between 0 (no variable selected) and 1 (all variables included).
#' @param ncomp the number of components to include in the model. Default to 1.
#' @param keepX A vector of same length as X.  Each entry keepX[i] is the
#' number of X[[i]]-variables kept in the model.
#' @param scheme Either "horst", "factorial" or "centroid" (Default: "horst").
#' @param mode character string. What type of algorithm to use, (partially)
#' matching one of \code{"regression"}, \code{"canonical"}, \code{"invariant"}
#' or \code{"classic"}. See Details.
#' @param scale boleean. If scale = TRUE, each block is standardized to zero
#' means and unit variances (default: TRUE)
#' @param init Mode of initialization use in the algorithm, either by Singular
#' Value Decompostion of the product of each block of X with Y ("svd") or each
#' block independently ("svd.single") . Default to "svd.single".
#' @param tol Convergence stopping value.
#' @param max.iter integer, the maximum number of iterations.
#' @param near.zero.var boolean, see the internal \code{\link{nearZeroVar}}
#' function (should be set to TRUE in particular for data with many zero
#' values). Setting this argument to FALSE (when appropriate) will speed up the
#' computations. Default value is FALSE
#' @param all.outputs boolean. Computation can be faster when some specific
#' (and non-essential) outputs are not calculated. Default = \code{TRUE}.
#' @return \code{wrapper.sgcca} returns an object of class \code{"sgcca"}, a
#' list that contains the following components:
#'
#' \item{data}{the input data set (as a list).} \item{design}{the input
#' design.} \item{variates}{the sgcca components.} \item{loadings}{the loadings
#' for each block data set (outer wieght vector).} \item{loadings.star}{the
#' laodings, standardised.} \item{penalty}{the input penalty parameter.}
#' \item{scheme}{the input schme.} \item{ncomp}{the number of components
#' included in the model for each block.} \item{crit}{the convergence
#' criterion.} \item{AVE}{Indicators of model quality based on the Average
#' Variance Explained (AVE): AVE(for one block), AVE(outer model), AVE(inner
#' model)..} \item{names}{list containing the names to be used for individuals
#' and variables.} More details can be found in the references.
